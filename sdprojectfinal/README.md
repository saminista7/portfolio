Abstract:<br />
The AUST Canteen website is a web platform to facilitate the events that occurred during our everyday actions in the university canteen. It’s made so that the performance of<br /> the canteen individuals towards their service is improved. The website gives the administrator power to the event handlers who control the actions of the canteen. <br />Orders can be taken through the website and kept track of all orders. The users can easily order and get their food from anywhere on campus.<br /><br />

Motivation:<br />
	The motivation to create this kind of website came from the idea of how analog the everyday canteen runs where which is one of the most important parts of our<br /> campus. This should be digitalized at all costs.<br />

<br />

Future Work:<br />
In the future, cart option can be added. Also, an OTP system and email verification system to avoid spam orders will be added.<br />
<br />

Conclusion:  <br />
This is a project that I loved working on. Hopefully, this can be used to make our AUST Canteen life easier.<br />
