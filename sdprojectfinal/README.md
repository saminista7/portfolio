Abstract:<br />
The AUST Canteen website is a web platform to facilitate the events occurred during our everyday actions in the university canteen. Itâ€™s made so that the performance of<br /> the canteen individuals towards their service is improved. The website gives the administrator power to the event handlers who control the actions of the canteen. <br />Orders can be taken through the website and kept track of all orders. The users can easily order and get their food from anywhere on campus.<br /><br />
