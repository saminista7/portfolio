Abstract: 
The AUST Canteen website is a web platform to facilitate the events occurred during our everyday actions in the university canteen. Itâ€™s made so that the performance of the canteen individuals towards their service is improved. The website gives the administrator power to the event handlers who control the actions of the canteen. Orders can be taken through the website and kept track of all orders. The users can easily order and get their food from anywhere on campus.
